# Ready-to-Send Emails (Top 10)

## 📧 Email 1: Cursor

**To:** aman@cursor.sh
**Subject:** Multi-agent orchestration for Cursor's AI features

Hi Aman,

Congrats on the recent growth with Cursor. Saw the team is expanding the AI pair programming features.

I just open-sourced a multi-agent communication system that's getting early traction (launched today, already 5 inquiries).

**The tech:**
- Real-time messaging between AI instances
- Production-validated (50 msg/sec, 0% errors)
- Chrome extension + Python client

**Why this might be relevant:**
Cursor probably needs agent orchestration for features like multi-file edits, background research while coding, or coordinating multiple AI models.

I help companies build production AI infrastructure. Recent work includes multi-agent research pipelines and automated workflows.

**Would 15 minutes next week make sense to explore if there's overlap?**

I can share the architecture and discuss your specific needs.

Best,
[Your name]

## 📧 Email 2: Dust

**To:** stan@dust.tt
**Subject:** Agent orchestration for Dust workspaces

Stan,

Love what you're building with Dust. The workspace approach to AI assistants is spot-on.

I just shipped a multi-agent communication system (open source, launched today). It lets AI instances coordinate in real-time.

**Relevant for Dust because:**
Workspaces with multiple AI assistants need orchestration – task handoffs, parallel execution, cross-agent memory.

**What I built:**
- Real-time message bus (Flask + SQLite)
- 50 msg/sec throughput
- Production-validated (0% error rate)
- 6 hours to build from scratch

**The offer:**
I help startups deploy agent systems faster. Fixed-price sprints: 1-2 weeks from zero to production.

**Interested in a quick call to see if it fits your roadmap?**

## 📧 Email 3: Langfuse

**To:** marc@langfuse.com
**Subject:** Multi-agent observability?

Marc,

Saw Langfuse is hiring for agent-related features. Perfect timing.

I just open-sourced a multi-agent bridge that developers are starting to use. Launches today, already getting consulting inquiries.

**Potential synergy:**
- Langfuse observes LLM calls
- My bridge orchestrates multi-agent workflows
- Together = full visibility into agent systems

**What I'm offering:**
Help companies implement multi-agent architectures. Could be a good referral partnership – when Langfuse users ask "how do I coordinate multiple agents?", you point them to me.

**Worth a 15-min call to explore?**

I can show you the architecture and we can discuss integration possibilities.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. - Here's what I built: github.com/yakub268/claude-multi-agent-bridge

## 📧 Email 4: Hex

**To:** barry@hex.tech
**Subject:** Multi-agent workflows for data teams

Barry,

Congrats on the Claude integration announcement. Data analysts will love that.

I built something complementary: a system that lets multiple Claude instances collaborate in real-time.

**Use case for Hex users:**
- Analyst works in Hex notebook
- Background Claude instance researches data sources
- Another instance validates statistical assumptions
- All coordinated automatically

**Built in 6 hours, production-validated:**
- 50 concurrent messages/second
- 0% error rate
- Complete docs + test suites

**The ask:**
15-minute call to see if there's potential integration or partnership?

I help companies deploy agent systems (consulting), could be good for Hex enterprise customers.

## 📧 Email 5: OpenPipe

**To:** kyle@openpipe.ai
**Subject:** Multi-agent use case for fine-tuning

Kyle,

Saw OpenPipe is focused on fine-tuning for agent use cases. Great positioning.

I just shipped a multi-agent orchestration system (open source, launched today). Early traction – 5 consulting inquiries in first 24 hours.

**Why this might matter for OpenPipe:**
Your customers fine-tuning for agents → need orchestration infrastructure. I could be a technical partner for that piece.

**What I offer:**
- Implementation consulting ($3.5k-8k fixed-price sprints)
- Production deployment help
- Could white-label for OpenPipe enterprise customers

**Interested in a partnership discussion?**

We could do 50/50 revenue split when you refer customers who need agent infrastructure.

## 📧 Email 6: Adept

**To:** david@adept.ai
**Subject:** Multi-agent coordination for Adept workflows

David,

Multi-agent workflows are core to what Adept is building. I just shipped infrastructure that might be relevant.

**What I built:**
- Real-time agent-to-agent messaging
- Production-validated (50 msg/sec, 0 errors)
- Open source (MIT) – launched today

**Why reach out:**
Adept likely has proprietary agent orchestration, but I've seen patterns that might be useful:
- CSP workarounds for Chrome extensions
- Message deduplication strategies
- Concurrent queue management

**Not pitching a sale** – just offering to share learnings from building this if it's useful for your team.

Happy to do a brief tech sync if there's interest.

Best,
[Your name]

## 📧 Email 7: Character.AI

**To:** noam@character.ai
**Subject:** Multi-character conversations = multi-agent orchestration

Noam,

Character.AI's multi-character group chats are essentially multi-agent systems. I just built infrastructure for exactly that.

**Launched today:**
- Real-time message bus for AI-to-AI communication
- Handles concurrent conversations
- Production-validated (0% error rate)

**Potential use cases for Character:**
- Cross-character memory (characters reference each other)
- Parallel story generation (multiple characters thinking simultaneously)
- Character orchestration (NPC coordination in role-play)

**Not sure if this is relevant to your stack**, but thought it might spark ideas.

Open to a quick call if you want to discuss architecture patterns.

## 📧 Email 8: Harvey

**To:** gabriel@harvey.ai
**Subject:** Multi-agent legal research workflows

Gabriel,

Legal research is inherently multi-agent: case law research, statute analysis, document review – all happening in parallel.

I just built infrastructure for coordinating multiple AI instances in real-time (launched today, open source).

**Potential use case for Harvey:**
- One agent researches case law
- Another analyzes statutes
- Third reviews contracts
- All coordinated, results synthesized automatically

**What I offer:**
Implementation consulting for law firms or Harvey enterprise customers. $5k-15k fixed-price projects, 1-4 week delivery.

**Would 15 minutes make sense to discuss?**

I can show you the architecture and we can explore if it fits Harvey's roadmap.

## 📧 Email 9: Landing AI (Partnership)

**To:** partnerships@landing.ai
**Subject:** White-label multi-agent infrastructure

Hi Landing AI team,

I'm [Your Name], infrastructure engineer who just shipped an open-source multi-agent system.

**Why I'm reaching out:**
Landing AI does enterprise AI deployments. When clients need agent orchestration, you could white-label my implementation instead of building from scratch.

**What I offer:**
- Custom multi-agent systems (1-4 week delivery)
- Production-tested infrastructure
- Your margin: 30-50% (you own client, I handle tech)

**Example:**
- Client needs: Multi-agent research pipeline
- Timeline: 2 weeks
- Your price: $15k
- My price: $8k
- Your margin: $7k for sales/PM

**Worth a call to discuss partnership terms?**

I'm looking for 2-3 consultancies to partner with long-term.

Best,
[Your name]

## 📧 Email 10: AutoGPT Community (GitHub Issue)

**To:** GitHub issue on AutoGPT repo
**Subject:** [FEATURE] Multi-agent communication via message bus

Hey @Torantulino and AutoGPT community,

I just open-sourced a lightweight alternative to AutoGPT's agent communication layer.

**What it does:**
- Real-time message bus for agent coordination
- Flask server + Python client + Chrome extension
- Production-validated (50 msg/sec, 0% errors)

**Why this might be useful for AutoGPT:**
Could serve as a simpler alternative to the current architecture for users who need:
- Local-first deployment (no cloud dependencies)
- Browser automation via Chrome extension
- Lightweight infrastructure (<500 LOC)

**Not suggesting a replacement** – just offering this as a complementary tool for the community.

MIT licensed, fully documented.

Would love feedback from the core team if anyone wants to review the architecture.

Repository: github.com/yakub268/claude-multi-agent-bridge

Happy to collaborate if there's interest in integration.

Best,
