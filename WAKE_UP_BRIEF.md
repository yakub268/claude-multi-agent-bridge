## 🚨 Common First-Day Scenarios

### "Nobody is engaging with my LinkedIn post"

**Wait 2 hours.** LinkedIn algorithm is slow.

If still nothing after 4 hours:
- Engage with 5 other posts (comment thoughtfully)
- Like/comment on connections' posts
- Algorithm boosts active users

### "Show HN got flagged/dead"

**Don't panic.** HN mods are strict about titles.

Options:
1. Wait for mod review (can take 6 hours)
2. Email hn@ycombinator.com explaining it's legitimate
3. Try again in 2 weeks with different angle

### "Emails are bouncing"

**Check email addresses.** Use Hunter.io to verify.

If still bouncing:
- Try LinkedIn DM instead
- Find alternative contact (CTO, Head of Eng)
- Move to next target on list

### "I got a consulting inquiry but don't know how to price"

**Use the packages:**
- Small project: $3,500 (1 week)
- Medium project: $8,500 (2 weeks)
- Large project: $15,000+ (4 weeks)

**Never go below $3,500.** If they can't afford it, they're not the right client.
