**Tweet 1 (Hook)**
```
I made two Claude instances talk to each other.

Not an API wrapper. Not a prompt chain.

Actual real-time, bidirectional AI-to-AI communication.

One line of Python. Open source. Here's how it works 🧵
```

**Tweet 2 (Problem)**
```
The workflow that made me snap:

• Ask Claude Code a question
• Switch to Browser Claude
• Ask again
• Copy the response
• Paste back to Code

5 manual steps. Every. Single. Time.
```

**Tweet 3 (Solution)**
```
Now it's this:

c.send('browser', 'command', {'text': 'Research React hooks'})
response = c.poll()

Browser Claude receives it. Types it. Thinks. Responds.

Your code gets the answer back automatically.

5 steps → 1 line.
```

**Tweet 4 (Architecture)**
```
How it works:

Python script → HTTP message bus → Chrome extension → claude.ai DOM

The extension types INTO the chat input, submits, watches for the response via MutationObserver, and sends it back through the bus.

No eval(). No CSP violations. Pure DOM manipulation.
```

**Tweet 5 (Use Cases)**
```
What this unlocks:

— Parallel research across models
— Multi-AI consensus on code decisions
— Context overflow? Route to a second instance
— Full workflow automation, zero copy-paste

This is the multi-agent IDE layer nobody built yet.
```

**Tweet 6 (Meta Moment — VIRAL HOOK)**
```
The part that broke my brain:

I used this tool to launch itself.

Browser Claude optimized these tweets while Code Claude built the repo.

Two AIs collaborating on their own communication layer.

We're through the looking glass.
```

**Tweet 7 (CTA)**
```
It's open source. MIT license. Working today.

⭐ github.com/yakub268/claude-multi-agent-bridge

Star it. Fork it. Build on it.

Multi-agent AI isn't coming — it's here.

## 📱 REDDIT POST (OPTIMIZED FOR r/ClaudeAI)

**Title:**
```
I got tired of being the copy-paste middleware between Claude Code and Browser Claude, so I built a bridge that lets them talk directly
```

**Body:**
```
If you use Claude Code for development and Browser Claude for research, you know the pain. You're constantly the middleman — copying context from one, pasting into the other, losing formatting, losing your mind.

So I built a communication layer between them. They now talk to each other directly over HTTP.

**What it actually does:**

```python
from code_client import CodeClient

c = CodeClient()
c.send('browser', 'command', {
    'text': 'What are React Server Components?'
})

# Browser Claude types it, responds
response = c.poll()  # Response comes back to your code
```

That's it. No tab switching. No copy-paste. Code Claude sends a query, Browser Claude processes it, response comes back — ~3 seconds end-to-end.

**How it works:**

1. **HTTP message bus** (Flask server, localhost:5001)
2. **Chrome extension** (injects into claude.ai, CSP-compliant)
3. **Python client** (send/receive messages)

The extension manipulates the DOM directly (no eval, no CSP violations), types into the chat input, submits, watches for the response via MutationObserver, and sends it back through the message bus.

**Some things I've been using it for:**

- Parallel research while coding (delegate tasks to Browser Claude, keep working)
- Multi-model consensus (ask both instances, compare answers)
- Access Browser Claude's full UI features (artifacts, projects, etc.) programmatically
- Automated workflows without context-switching

**The meta part that still trips me out:** I used this system to help build and launch itself. Browser Claude helped refine the README while Code Claude wrote the implementation. Two Claudes collaborating on their own communication layer felt like a threshold moment.

**Status:** Working, MIT licensed, examples included. Tested on macOS and Windows.

**GitHub:** github.com/yakub268/claude-multi-agent-bridge

Happy to answer questions about the architecture or edge cases. If you try it, I'd genuinely love to hear what use cases you come up with — I'm sure there are workflows I haven't thought of.

---

**TL;DR:** Built an open-source bridge that lets Claude Code and Browser Claude communicate directly via HTTP. No more copy-paste. One line of code sends a query from one instance and gets back the other's response. MIT licensed, working today.

## 🟠 HACKER NEWS STRATEGY

**Best Title:**
```
Show HN: A bridge for Claude instances to communicate with each other in real time
```

**Why this works:** HN titles that perform best are factual, specific, and describe what the thing does — not what it means. No superlatives, no emojis, no "I built." The "Show HN:" prefix already implies you made it. Under 80 character limit.

**Backup Title Options:**
```
Show HN: Real-time communication between Claude Code and Browser Claude
Show HN: HTTP bridge for multi-agent Claude workflows
```

**First Comment (Post as Maker):**
```
Hey HN — I made this because I got tired of being the middleware between Claude Code (terminal) and Browser Claude (browser). I'd ask the same question twice, copy-paste responses between them, and lose context constantly.

This bridges them via HTTP. Code Claude can send prompts to Browser Claude, Browser Claude processes them, and responses come back automatically. End-to-end latency is ~3 seconds.

**Architecture:**
- Flask message bus (localhost:5001)
- Chrome extension (Manifest v3, CSP-compliant)
- Python client API
- DOM manipulation (no eval, no dynamic script injection)
- MutationObserver for response extraction

**What I learned:**
- claude.ai's CSP is strict — had to use pure DOM manipulation
- Chrome caches extension files aggressively (15+ reloads to get changes loaded)
- "Thinking" status never leaves the DOM — had to watch for "Done" instead
- Message bus needs timestamp filtering or you get the backlog on startup

**Use cases I've found:**
- Parallel research (keep coding while Browser Claude researches)
- Multi-model consensus (compare responses)
- Access Browser Claude's UI features (artifacts, projects) programmatically

**Limitations:**
- Chrome-only right now (Firefox support planned)
- Requires local message bus running
- No message persistence (in-memory queue)
- Response extraction relies on DOM structure (could break if claude.ai changes)

It's not that complex under the hood — the value is in having a reliable protocol for multi-agent workflows. Open to questions about the architecture or suggestions for improvements.

**How to Handle Common HN Criticisms:**

**"This is just screen scraping with extra steps"**
```
Fair characterization of the browser side. The Chrome extension does manipulate the DOM. I looked at alternatives — there's no official API for Browser Claude conversations, so this was the pragmatic path. The value isn't in the extraction method, it's in the communication protocol sitting on top of it. If Anthropic ships a conversation API tomorrow, the message bus and client interface stay the same, only the browser adapter changes.
```

**"Why not just use the API directly instead of Browser Claude?"**
```
You absolutely can for most use cases, and for production workflows you should. This solves a specific niche: when you want the Browser Claude experience (projects, artifacts, web search, persistent context) orchestrated programmatically from Code Claude. The API and Browser Claude aren't equivalent feature sets right now.
